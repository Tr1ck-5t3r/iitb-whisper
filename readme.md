##Introduction
Whisper is an innovative tool by openai that helps to transcribe and translate to multiple languages. Objective of this project was to implement Openai-whisper on kathbath dataset and to evaluate the performance of the model using wer.

##About
I have implemented the openai-whisper on kathbath dataset for test audios along with the dataset provided by iit-b and evaluated the performance of the model using wer.

#kathbath dataset

- code: kathbath-whisper.ipynb
- dataset,results of transcriptions: results-kathbath-whisper.csv

#iit dataset

- code: iit-assignment-whisper.ipynb
- dataset,results of transcriptions: results-iit-assignment-whisper.csv

##Results
The model was able to transcribe the kathbath hindi dataset with a wer of 40.75%. The model was able to transcribe and translate the iit-b dataset with a wer of 69.02 %.

##Conclusion
The model was able to transcribe the kathbath dataset with a wer of 40.75%. I was succesfully able to implement the openai-whisper on kathbath dataset and evaluate the performance of the model using wer. I thank you for this opportunity and I am eager to join your team and contribute to the project. Thank you for your time and consideration.
